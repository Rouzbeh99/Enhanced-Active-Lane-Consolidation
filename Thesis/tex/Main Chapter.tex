\chapter{Main Chapter}

SIMD intructions allow modern processor to apply the same Intruction on multiple data at the ame time. The performance improvement gained from these intructions is 
so considerable(?) that made compiler specialists to explore different ways to exploite SIMD intructions. Auto-vectorization [cite] is a compiler tranformation that is proposed
for this purpose. Implemented by almost all current compilers, auto-vectorization looks for possibility of using SIMD instructions (also called vector instructions) in the program and replaces
scalar code (code that is made of simple instructions) with vector instructions wherever possible.

A huge amount of work has been done to improve codes using vectorization [cite] however, the transformation needs the code to meet certain requirements which if not met, would result in invalid code
produced by the compilers. Furthuremore, replacing scalar code with vector is not always benefitial. In some situations(?) scalar code can provide better performace in comparison to vector code.
In response to these two problems with vectorization, compilers come with an analysis pass to check both legality of the tranformation and it's profitability.
