\chapter{Main Chapter}

SIMD intructions allow modern processor to apply the same Intruction on multiple data at the ame time. The performance improvement gained from these intructions is 
so considerable(?) that made compiler specialists to explore different ways to exploite SIMD intructions. Auto-vectorization [cite] is a compiler tranformation that is proposed
for this purpose. Implemented by almost all current compilers, auto-vectorization looks for possibility of using SIMD instructions (also called vector instructions) in the program and replaces
scalar code (code that is made of simple instructions) with vector instructions wherever possible.

Since most of the execution time of a program is spent on loops, vectorization is typically applied on loops. Famous Compilers have optimization passes (such as slp-vectorizer in clang ... [cite, more examples])
that vectorize loops body. In spite of loop-vectorization there has been efforts to vectorize other structres such as functions [cite] as well however, the focus of research in this area is on loops.

A huge amount of work has been done to improve codes using vectorization [cite] however, the transformation needs the code to meet certain requirements which if not met, would result in invalid code
produced by the compilers. Furthuremore, replacing scalar code with vector is not always benefitial. In some situations(?) scalar code can provide better performace in comparison to vector code.
In response to these two problems with vectorization, compilers come with an analysis pass to check both legality of the tranformation and it's profitability.

One of the larget obstacles for vectorization has always been control flow divergence. Existence of branches (such as if-then-else statements or swithch case statements) causes the program to take different paths during execution time 
based on some conditions inside the code that could change dynamically. This is called divergence in the control flow of the program. Having divergence in the code, vectorization can not be simply applied,
as different iterations of the loop might take different paths and as a result disabling the compiler to replace instructions with SIMD ones. 

To deal with divergence in the code, a tranformation called "Control Flow Linearization" has been proposed. Modern Processors contain "predicated instructions". in predicated instructions, every single instruction is 
gaurded by a one bit predicate which could be either 1 or 0. The result of execution of the instruction will be committed only if that predicate bit is set to 1. Otherwise, the result will be discarded leaving no architectural(?) effect e.g: memory writes (?),... .
Having "Predicated Vector instructions" in the processor, compilers will be able to vectorize codes with divergence by first Linearizing control flow and then replacing scalar instructions with vectorized ones.
This is the most widely taken approach to vector such codes with divergence, But there are probelms with this approach.

To demonstrate possible shortcomings with this approach, let's follow a simple example: 

% \begin{algorithm}
%     \caption{Motivating Example}\label{euclid}
%     \begin{algorithmic}[1]
%     \For{$i \gets 0$ to $N$ by 1}
%         \If{($i \bmod $2) == 1} 
%             \State $C_{i} \gets $($A_{i} + B_{i}$) 
%         \Else
%             \State $B_{i} \gets $($A_{i} - C_{i}$) 
%         \EndIf 
%     \EndFor

%     \end{algorithmic}

% \end{algorithm}


\begin{lstlisting}[language=C]
    for(i = 0; i < n; i++){
        if(i%2 == 0){
            a[i] = b[i] * c[i];
        }else{
            b[i] = a[i] * c[i];
        }
    }
